This little 40% ortho punches well above its weight and its price tag. Tough enough to survive life on the go or beating down someone that disses it.
It's got all the configuration options you'd ever want in a 40%. All the components are through-hole so it's a great first keyboard kit to put togethether.
You will need a pro micro for the PCB which gives you lots of options for extra features. You can solder in an elite c to get USB C or even a nice nano to make it wireless! There's plenty of room between the PCB and the bottom plate for a huge lithium battery.
This would be a vicious travel keyboard, a macro pad for productivity people, the first ortho for people who want to try ortho, or just a cute little keyboard to lend to people when they need one.
